# VS-MAP-MATE
This code main branch compiles on NXP MCUXpresso and runs on Teensy 3.5. You can communicate with the Teensy using MAP-MATE if you choose. The MKS20 development branch is the currently supported and developed actively, please clone MKS20_DEVELOP and run that on the Sparkdog MKS20 controller board.

## Install
To run the project, you need a Teensy 3.5 or a Sparkdog MKS20 controller. You can create the hex to download using binary utilities and load using Teensy.exe, or JTAG and fully debug by soldering the ARM single wire debug interface onto the Teensy 3.5 or Sparkdog MKS20 controller. Segger J-link and PEMicro Universal are both debuggers I have used.
